SpinJa TODOs

MAJOR
 -  Implementation of unless statement.
 -  Implememtation of user defined typedef definitions
 -  Implementation of SPIN's -DREVERSE -DP_RAND -DT_REVERSE -DT_RANDOM modes

MINOR
 -  Implementation of missing communication primitives:
        sorted send             ch!!
        random receive          ch??
        non-removing receive    ch?<..>

 -  Implementation of remote references (i.e. P@label and P:label).

 -  Implementation of special variables/functions: np_, pc_value, enabled

 -  Full support for d_step sequences:
     -  support for labels in d_step sequences
     -  support for communication within d_step sequences

 -  Fix automatic resizing of hash table when hash table gets full
    (i.e., parameter to -w is too low). 
        Now the checker seems to get into some kind of livelock and 
        does not proceed/respond anymore.

 -  spinja/options/OptionParser.java
        OptionParser::printUsage()
            When printing the options, the options should be printed
            in alphabetical order, but *ignoring* case. Currently,
            first the uppercase options are printed, and then the 
            lowercase options.

 -  Simulation: show a more user friendly error trace 
    (see for instance the Erigone model checker).
